                    <br>
                    <p>Yesterday, while waiting for my professor to come, I decided to contemplate at sixth floor window of the STI building.</p>
                    
                    <p>With my earphones on, I ignored the world for a few minutes. I started to look from the top view of the area where STI is located. For a short period of time, I felt that everything was perfect. The way it looks like from the arial view seems everything was okay.
                    </p>

                   
            
                    <p>Then a thought came to my mind, that later, after my class, I will be included in this picture of perfection where I'm looking right now. Me, as a man who is not perfect at all.</p>
                    
                    <p>Reality struck me when I realized that the picture that seemed perfect looks broken in a more focused view. Everyone has their own challenges that they need to overcome for every single day of their existence. And that's why I wondered, when even myself, despite of those brokeness, can see that it is a wonderful picture in a whole, "Does Jesus also feel what I felt when I was looking from the top view of this scenery? Does He feel that kind of perfection in His creation despite of those brokeness in a more nearer perspective?" </p>
            
                    
                    <p>Then I was reminded in this verse in Romans 8:28 in Amplified Bible Version saying:
                        "And we know [with great confidence] that God [who is deeply concerned about us] causes all things to work together [as a plan] for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to His plan and purpose."</p>

                    <p>And that answered the missing part of the picture that I'm looking for. I thank God that my struggles right now is connected to someone for better, that my struggles today has a purpose not only for me but also to the people around me. And in God's perspective, everything is perfect because He can see the very detail of His creation according to His own masterpiece.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">One's struggle is essential for the perfection of His plan for all eternity.</p>
